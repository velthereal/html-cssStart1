	<h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
	<h2>Linear Equations</h2>
	<p>
		A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
	</p>
	<p class="block"><span class="color">ax + b = 0</span></p>
	<p>
		where <span class="letter">a</span> and  <span class="letter">b</span> are real numbers and  <span class="letter">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an  <span class="letter">x</span> so don't get too locked into always seeing an  <span class="letter">x</span> there.
	</p>
	<h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
	<p>
		The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
	</p>
	<p class="block"><span class="color">axÂ² + bx + c = 0</span></p>
	<p>
		where  <span class="letter">a</span>,  <span class="letter">b</span>, <span class="letter">c</span> are known values and  <span class="letter">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="letter">a</span> can't be 0.
	</p>
	<h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>
	<p>
		<span class="letter">&#960;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="letter">r</span>) squared:
	</p>
	<p class="block"><span class="color">A = &#960; x r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
	<p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="letter">D</span>):</p>
	<p class="block"><span class="color">A = (&#960;/4) x D<sup>2</sup></span></p>
	<p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="letter">C</span>):</p>
	<p class="block"><span class="color">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 x &#960;</span></p>
	<h2>Intersection</h2>
	<p>The intersection of two sets <span class="letter">A</span> and <span class="letter">B</span>. denoted by AB, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
	<p class="block"><span class="color">A &cap; B = {x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B}</span></p>
	<p>
		That is, <span class="letter">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap;B if and only if <span class="letter">x</span> is both an element of <span class="letter">A</span> and an element of <span class="letter">B</span>.
