		<h1>My "perfect" life or something like this</h1>
	<p class="parag">
		I am Valeria and I am 18 years old. It seems that I have lived an eternity, but people older than me will laugh and say that this is just the beginning.

	<h2>My childhood</h2>
	<p class="text">
		I was born in 2005. Everything was wonderful, I was a beloved daughter, granddaughter, niece and the like. All the attention and love was mine. But it was not for long. Once, they brought a SISTER who was always crying to our home. And on the same day I had to grow up. My sister was so sweet and soft that I couldn't take a step away from her. We grew up together because I'm only 1 year older than her, so my childhood was fun. At the age of 6, I went to school and soon found out that I would soon have a little brother. My sister and I were looking forward to it. The three of us were always busy, constantly having fun. We will have something to remember.

	<h2>Is this how I spent most of my life?</h2>
	<p class="text">
		At school I was an ordinary quiet student. I studied well, tried to earn a good reputation. Everything was great until I entered the 6th grade. Perhaps at one point the idea appeared in my head that learning is not necessary, the main thing in life is fun. I got good grades just to please my parents. Like all teenagers, I spent 80% of the time walking, often disobeying my parents, running away from home and many other things.

	<h2>Awareness...</h2>
	<p class="text">
		Then came the pandemic. It was a turning point in my life. I had enough time to understand what was really important. I started thinking about my future and what I would like to do. There were a lot of ideas of what could be done. I knew that I had a dream - to become a surgeon. But after thinking about this idea for a long time, I realized that I have no desire to study hard for 10 years and only after such a long time be useful to people. Then I became interested in IT and programming. And from that moment I began to learn everything I could about this field.

	<h2>"Everything that doesn't kill us makes us stronger"</h2>
	<p class="text">
		Of course, it was not without problems. Like every person in this world, there were many difficult moments. They often gave up, there was no desire and no sense to do anything. At such moments, someone who supported and helped always appeared. Then the strength appeared to go on. Having experienced so much in my 18 years, I think that I have no right to give up now, but on the contrary, I must continue to move on, achieve my goals and become happier.
